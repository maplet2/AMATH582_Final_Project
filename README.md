# Exploratory Analysis of Large-Scale Electrode Neurol Recording
A collaborative project that explores Neurology data gathered through neural recording technologies such as Neuropixels. In particular, we are searching for area specific patterns and low dimensional dynamics in our data using Singular Value Decompostion, Principal Component Analysis and a variety of supervised and unsupervised learning.
